This is still the same GOP that attempted to usurp the presidential election &amp; collaborated w/ white supremacists to attack the US Capitol.  Protecting voting rights &amp; mobilizing everybody - not just suburbs - is crucial\n",
      "1444369093218471938 2021-10-02 19:30:01 +0000 <AOC> Also I don’t see how it makes sense to frame this infra bill as the #1 determinant of the midterms when the same slow-walkers here are halting voting rights.  Could pass the best bill ever &amp; it’s all a wash if Black &amp; underserved voters are systematically disenfranchised next yr.\n",
      "1444365749695533056 2021-10-02 19:16:44 +0000 <AOC> Many newer moderates won on pledges of rejecting corporate PACs. It’s a progressive value that went mainstream bc no matter your views, most people dislike big money in politics.  That’s also why framing this as “mod vs prog” is inaccurate - it’s a much smaller group stonewalling\n",

That empowers you to give your input. &amp; THAT is of so much more service to you than discussing optics or political beefs or whatever\n",

We can do that by taxing the rich to offset, cutting universal pre-k, or shortening the funding time.  All can bring outlay down. Which one do you prefer?\n",

      "1444360985767301133 2021-10-02 18:57:48 +0000 <AOC> &amp; I suspect it may also be why you see media reflexively centering coverage of these bills on a number instead of what’s actually in them.  The thing is, 1 number doesn’t tell you anything. It doesn’t help you as a normal person understand at ALL how your life could improve.\n",
